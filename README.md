# N-queens-visualizer
The N-Queens Visualizer is an interactive tool for visualizing solutions to the classic N-Queens problem — placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This project helps users understand backtracking algorithms by watching the solving process step by step.
# Features
🎲 Choose any board size N (typically between 4 and 20).

🔍 Step-by-step visualization of the backtracking algorithm.

♟️ Clear display of queen placements and conflicts.

🖼️ Animated solving process for better understanding.
